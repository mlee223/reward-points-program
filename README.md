# Reward Program

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction.

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

The data model implemented is in `src/data`
